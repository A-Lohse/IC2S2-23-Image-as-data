        "\n",
        "1. The next real challenge is using your own data. First you need to label it. This takes time but given that you now know a bit about using pre-trained networks, you might only need to label 100-1000 images to get okay results.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It can be a hassle creating you own data loader of custom data, but it is 100% doable. It might just require some trial and error.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. We have only really done image classification here. Chances are that if you are doing anything more serious you might want to do object detection or segmentation. Don't worry: the models are a bit more complicated but they exist and you can use pre-trained models here as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Also, for custom annotations for object detection and segmentation tools such as LabelImg can help: https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The Pytorch API for pre-trained models is going to change a bit in the future. Nothing major, but you will be able to choose between different pre-trained weights for each model. That is super nice, but it also means that the `pretrained = True` argument is going to be deprecated. See https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-torchvision-new-multi-weight-support-api/ for more.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Lastly, for this for this (and the previous) exercise we have imported models straight from pytorch and used native pytorch for everything. This is works very well, but if you going to use pre-trained models and want something a bit more powerful look into detectron2. This is especially important if you want to do more complicated stuff like object detection and semantic. Detectron2 is kind of a API wrapper around a lot of pre-defined and pre-trained models all implemented in pytorch. It is super powerful and it works very similar to what you just did. Indeed it is actually a bit more intuitive here and there when you get to know it. This links might prove useful. \n",
